###Info
Color Utility is open source, developed for a contest.

You can download the source and try it and trust the developer by reviewing it. You can always **fork** and **contribute**. 

I want this to be used in schools when they teach about light and color. Educators, if you might, please notify(contact) me when you use my program. I will be *super* pleased.
