#Color Utility

![screenshot!](screenshot.png)

Color Utility is open source, developed for a contest ([제 30회 한국정보올림피아드](https://www.digitalculture.or.kr/sub06/InfoOlympiad.do)) where it won a silver medal.

I want this to be used in schools when they teach about light and color. Teachers, please contact me if you do use my program. I will be *super* pleased.
