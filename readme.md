Color Utility is open source, developed for a contest([제 30회 한국정보올림피아드](https://www.digitalculture.or.kr/sub06/InfoOlympiad.do)) where it won a silver medal.

You can download the source and try it and trust the developer by reviewing it. You can always **fork** and **contribute**. 

I want this to be used in schools when they teach about light and color. Teachers, please contact me if you do use my program. I will be *super* pleased.
